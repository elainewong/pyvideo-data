We will see why configuration management\nis important and how we can use Ansible to automatically deploy and test\nfull production clusters - showcased with a sample Django application -\nwith just a single command and in a number of different environments.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWith modern configuration, deployment and orchestration systems,\nsoftware developers can easily maintain, bring up and tear down local\ntest systems, staging, demonstration and production systems, which are\n100% identical to each other.\n\nThis presentation will give an introduction to Ansible, a modern, simple\nand efficient configuration management system. We will see how we can\ndeploy complete clusters (with load balancers, database and some Django\napplication servers), reliably and fully automated, either on dedicated\nservers, on local virtual machines or in the cloud.\n\nIf all goes well, there will even be a live demo in which we will bring\nup a complete cluster or two in different environments, to illustrate\nthe power of this approach.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/juergen-brendel-deploying-test-and-production-systems-with-ansible\n\n",
